# Bio
st.header('About Me')
st.write("""
I developed an interest in UX design and research through my experiences interacting with my family members and the disability groups in an internship. While I grew a deep fascination in human factors, I became aware of the importance of bringing more accessible and sustainable designs for minority and senior groups who should also be benefited by technological development.

My research in HCI has ranged from launching a senior AI healthcare platform at the Seattle start-up that brings high-tech healthcare senior product, to building a metaverse extension for the Zoom office product that creates an immersive video communication experience.

Iâ€™ve explored a variety of approaches including data visualization, machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, VR/AR, etc.

In my free time, you can find me dancing K-pop and Jazz, traveling, staying with my cats, playing the pianos, and expanding my ever-growing collection of different cat foods in the world.
